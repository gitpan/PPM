
This is version 2.1.1 of the Perl Package Manager, PPM.

See the POD contained in bin/ppm.pl for information on how to use the
PPM client.

See the POD contained in lib/PPM.pm for information on how to use the
PPM library to write an alternative client.

Warning: This version of PPM may not be entirely usable, in its current
form, outside of ActiveState ActivePerl Perl distributions.  Any patches
(particularly documentation and setup) that make it a more generally
useful tool will be gratefully accepted.

Quick Start:

    o Edit lib/ppm.xml, changing 
        %OSNAME% => set to the output of 'perl -V:osname'
        %OSVERSION% => 'x,x,x,x' (e.g. '2,7,0,0' for Solaris 2.7)
        %TEMP% => set to your TEMP environment variable
        %SITELIB% => set to the output of 'perl -V:sitelib'
        %PERLDIR%  => set to the output of 'perl -V:prefix'

Needless to say, this could all be fairly easily added to
Makefile.PL--again, patches are welcome!
